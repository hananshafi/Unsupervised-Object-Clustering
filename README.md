# Unsupervised-Object-Clustering
This repository presents a method of extracting different objects from images and then clustering them in unsupervised manner. For extracting different objects from images the algorithm used is MSER. Clustering is carried out using CNN based feature extraction followed by DBSCAN.


step1: Make a folder by name "screen" in the same directory as the code.
step2: Run find_object_cluster function in clutstering.py file with appropriate paths.
